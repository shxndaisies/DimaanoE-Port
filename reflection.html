<p>I learned a lot this quarter. I discovered that creating a website involves more than just HTML; we can enhance its visual appeal using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). I realized that a website doesn't have to be plain or boring because CSS allows for better styling. I believe CSS is essential for making every website presentable. </p>
